This program makes use of pre-written code from my textbook (Die.java) and modified code (DieTriplet.java) and (RollTriplet.java) that I modified to roll three dice 5000 times while countng every single time the dice all land on one (Makes use of multiple classes and methods).

Here is a quick test of the program:

Use Cases:

 - Backend calling of multiple methods in different classes 
 - Learning how to use multiple classes

Problems: 

 - I do not see any logical or runtime errors with this program.
